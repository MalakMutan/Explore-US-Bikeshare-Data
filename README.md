# **Explore US Bikeshare Data**  

This project aims to explore and analyze bikeshare usage data in major US cities. It includes an analysis of the time periods during which bikes are used in cities such as **Chicago, Washington, and New York City**.  

## **Requirements**  

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

## **Installation**

   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

## **Usage**  

To analyze bikeshare data, you can run the script `bikeshare.py` using Python. The script requires the following CSV files to function properly:  

- `chicago.csv`  
- `new_york_city.csv`  
- `washington.csv`  

Run the script using:
